How it works--

its winsock control listens on port 80 waiting for a computer to connect.
When one does, if the computer is requesting the homepage, it opens the homepage
file in the rich text box control, then sends the text in it to the client.
when the client requests a picture, the server opens the pic in the richtextbox control
then sends that to the client. I added a feature where you can change the root directory
and edit files, but it is not needed. Take some time to look at the code to figure out
exactaly how i did it.

To test it on your computer---

run the webserver with a root directory that has an 'index.html' file in it. 
In Internet explorer, type in 'http://localhost/' to get to the webserver. Have fun!
